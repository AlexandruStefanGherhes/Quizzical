### About this project

This is my react project from scrimba. My task is to create a dynamic website for a quiz game using openTrivia API and publish it into netlify. I used my knowledge about react, effect, state, API fetch and jsx to assemble components to make this project. This is a responsive website which means it will display correctly on any device with various widths and heights.
